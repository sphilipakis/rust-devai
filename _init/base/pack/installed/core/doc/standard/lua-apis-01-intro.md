#### File Path supported

AIPack supports several types of file paths:

| Type                   | Example                                  | Notes                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Relative               | `some/file.txt`                          | Relative to the workspace directory                                                                     |
| Absolute               | `/absolute/path/file.txt`                | Absolute path (`C:/` on Windows)                                                                        |
| Pack Ref               | `my_org@my_pack/path/file.txt`           | Finds the closest pack (in custom workspace, custom base, or install base) and uses this as a directory |
| Home Tilde             | `~/path/to/file.txt`                     | User home directory; `~` is replaced by the home directory (or `/` if no home directory is found)       |
| Session TMP            | `$tmp/some/file.txt`                     | Located in `.aipack/.sessions/_uid_/` within the workspace; unique per session (until command stops)    |
| Workspace Pack Support | `my_org@my_pack$workspace/some/file.txt` | Maps to `.aipack/support/pack/my_org/my_pack/some/file.txt` in the workspace                            |
| Base Pack Support      | `my_org@my_pack$base/some/file.txt`      | Maps to `.aipack-base/support/pack/my_org/my_pack/some/file.txt` in the base directory                  |

Important notes:

- The workspace directory is the parent directory of the `.aipack/` folder. Like `.git` or `.vscode`, the `.aipack/` folder marks a directory as the workspace.
- The pack support directory suffixes `$workspace` and `$base` must appear immediately after the pack name.
- These paths can be used in globs (e.g., `aip.file.list({"~/path/to/**/*.md", "pro@rust10x/guide/**/*.md"})`).

#### AI Response

An `ai_response` variable will be injected into the scope in the `# Output` Lua code block if an instruction was given and an AI request occurred (otherwise, it will be `nil`).

```ts
{
  // The final text response from the AI, if available.
  content?: string,
  // A formatted string capturing essential details like usage, price, model, and duration of the request, using the fields below.
  info: string,
  // e.g., `gpt-5-mini`
  model_name: string,
  // e.g., `openai`
  adapter_kind: AdapterKind,
  // Token usage details.
  usage: {
    prompt_tokens: number,
    completion_tokens: number
  },
  // The approximate price in USD, if available.
  price_usd?: number,
  // Duration in seconds (with millisecond precision).
  duration_sec: number,
  // Reasoning content, if available (e.g., from deepseek or some groq models).
  reasoning_content?: string,
}
```


#### Global and Injected Variables:

- All stage Lua code blocks and required scripts receive a [`CTX`](#ctx) variable containing context information (e.g., `CTX.AGENT_NAME`, `CTX.TMP_DIR`, etc.).
- All stage Lua code blocks also receive `options`, which includes `.model` and `.input_concurrency`.
- `# Before All` stage Lua code blocks receive `inputs` (can be `nil` if no inputs are given).
- `# Data` stage Lua code blocks receive `input` (can be `nil` if no input is provided) and the return value from the `# Before All` stage (`before_all`, which can be `nil`).
- `# Output` stage Lua code blocks receive `input`, `ai_response` (can be `nil`), `data` (the return value from the `# Data` stage), and `before_all`.
- `# After All` stage Lua code blocks receive `outputs` (return values from each `# Output` stage), `inputs`, and `before_all`.

**NOTE**

> All of the type documentation is noted in "TypeScript style" as it is a common and concise type notation for scripting languages and works well to express Lua types.
>       However, it is important to note that there is no TypeScript support, just standard Lua. For example, Lua properties are delimited with `=` and not `:',
>       and arrays and dictionaries are denoted with `{ }`.


#### nil vs. null

Lua has the `nil` keyword which partially acts like a common `null` but not exactly.

 For that reason, AIPack also adds the global concept of `null` (also aliased as `Null` and `NULL`) that behaves closer to JSON, JS, SQL, and other nulls.

Here are the key differences:

**`nil`**

- Native to `Lua`
- Means no value or property does not exist.
    - Limitation: We have no way to know if the property had a "null" value or just was not there.
- When put in an array `{"one", "two", nil, "four"}` this will actually stop the iterator (i.e., `ipairs`) on the first nil. For example:
```lua
local values = {"one", "two", nil, "four"}
for i, v in ipairs(values) do
    print("" .. i .. ": " .. v)
end
-- Will print: "1: one", "2: two"
-- NOTE: We won't see `4: four` because the iterator stop at first nil
```

**`null`**

 Added by `AIPack` to all Lua contexts, with keyword `null`. (It is also aliased as `Null` and `NULL` for convenience).
- Behaves like a JavaScript null, and can be used in variables, property values, and array items
- In Array
```lua
local values = {"one", "two", null, "four"}
for i, v in ipairs(values) do
    print("" .. i .. ": " .. v)
end
-- Will print: "1: one", "2: two", "3: null", "4: four"
```
- Works in objects as well, and when converting to JSON
```lua
local contact = {
    name: "Jen",
    home: null,
    phone: nil, -- NOTE the lua "nil" here
    title: "Director"
}
print(contact)
-- Will print: {home = null,name = "Jen",title = "Director"}
-- Note: "home" is present with null, but phone is not

local contact_json = aip.json.stringify(contact)
print(contact_json)
-- Will print: {"home":null,"name":"Jen","title":"Director"}
-- Note: Similar to the lua print.
```

**When to use `nil` vs. `null`**

- Use `null`
    - In arrays, use `null` over `nil` since the Lua `nil` will have some unexpected side effect, it stops iterators
    - In object property values when wanting to keep the property name when the value is null. Using `nil`, the property will be virtually "erased."
- Use `nil`
    - When using simple variable initialization, e.g., `local origin_path = nil`
    - In object property values when it's okay to not preserve the property name when it's nil. 

So, if you're still not sure, use `null` in arrays, and you can use either `nil` or `null` in other scenarios.

**Important Comparison Note**

In Lua, `nil` and the `null` sentinel are different types. A simple `val == nil` check will return `false` if `val` is `null`. Always use the [Global Null Helpers](#global-null-helpers) (`is_null`, `nil_if_null`, `value_or`) to safely compare or handle these values.


### Global Null Helpers

AIPack provides several global functions to safely handle both `nil` and `null` values.

**`is_null(value)`**

Returns `true` if the `value` is either `nil` or the `null` sentinel.

```lua
is_null(nil)   -- true
is_null(null)  -- true
is_null(false) -- false
```

**`nil_if_null(value)`**

Returns `nil` if the `value` is `null` or `nil`. Otherwise, returns the value itself. This is useful when calling functions that do not support the `null` sentinel.

```lua
local v = nil_if_null(null) -- v is nil
```

**`value_or(value, alt)`**

Returns `value` if it is not `nil` and not `null`. Otherwise, returns `alt`.

```lua
local name = value_or(input.name, "Anonymous")
```
